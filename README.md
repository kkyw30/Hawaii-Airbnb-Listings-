# Hawaii-Airbnb-Listings-
This project represents a first attempt at analyzing data for Airbnb listings in Hawaii. We focus on price prediction based on commonly used parameters such as beds, 
number of accommodates, and the general region in which the listing is located, as well as extracting natural language processing insights based on hosts' 
descriptions of themselves and their listings. 

This project relies heavily on commonly used Python data analysis libraries including sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, and pandas, among many others. The files are 
modularized according to their intended function.
